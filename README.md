Sarvam LLM Team:  Assignment 2 : Implement einops from scratch
# Einops From Scratch

This project implements a subset of the popular `einops` library functionality from scratch, focusing on the core `rearrange` operation for tensor manipulation.

## Overview

The implementation provides a clean and efficient way to manipulate tensors using Einstein notation-inspired syntax, similar to the original `einops` library. It supports operations such as:

- Reshaping
- Transposition
- Splitting of axes
- Merging of axes
- Repeating of axes
- Ellipsis (...) for handling batch dimensions

## Implementation Approach

### Core Components

1. **Pattern Parser**: Efficiently parses the einops pattern strings using regex and caching
2. **Shape Calculator**: Determines the appropriate shapes for input and output tensors
3. **Tensor Manipulator**: Performs the actual reshaping and transposition operations

### Design Decisions

- **Performance Optimization**:
  - Used `@lru_cache` for memoizing repeated pattern parsing
  - Implemented efficient regex-based pattern parsing
  - Reduced intermediate tensor operations where possible
  - Added fast paths for common operations

- **Error Handling**:
  - Comprehensive validation of patterns, dimensions, and arguments
  - Clear and informative error messages for debugging

- **Maintainability**:
  - Clean separation of parsing, validation, and tensor operations
  - Well-documented code with type hints
  - Comprehensive test suite for verification

## Usage

```python
import numpy as np
from einops_implementation import rearrange

# Transpose a tensor
x = np.random.rand(3, 4)
result = rearrange(x, 'h w -> w h')

# Split an axis
x = np.random.rand(12, 10)
result = rearrange(x, '(h w) c -> h w c', h=3, w=4)

# Merge axes
x = np.random.rand(3, 4, 5)
result = rearrange(x, 'a b c -> (a b) c')

# Handle batch dimensions with ellipsis
x = np.random.rand(2, 3, 4, 5)
result = rearrange(x, '... h w -> ... (h w)')
```

## Running the Code

1. First, ensure you have NumPy installed:
   ```
   pip install numpy
   ```

2. Import the implementation:
   ```python
   from optimized_einops import rearrange
   ```

3. Use the `rearrange` function as shown in the examples above.

## Running the Tests

The implementation includes a comprehensive test suite to verify correctness across various use cases and edge cases.

```python
# Run all tests
python -m unittest test_einops.py

# Run specific test class
python -m unittest test_einops.TestEinopsBasic
```

## Implementation Features

- **Syntax Support**:
  - Axis renaming: `'a b -> b a'`
  - Axis grouping: `'a b -> (a b)'`
  - Axis splitting: `'(a b) -> a b'`
  - Batch dimensions: `'... h w -> ... (h w)'`

- **Edge Cases**:
  - Handling of unusual input shapes
  - Proper validation of operations
  - Memory-efficient transformations

## Performance

The implementation focuses on performance optimization by:

1. Minimizing intermediate tensor operations
2. Caching parsed patterns for repeated use
3. Using vectorized operations where possible
4. Special case handling for common operations

## Limitations

- Implements only the `rearrange` operation (not `reduce` or `repeat`)
- Works only with NumPy arrays (not other deep learning frameworks)
- Some complex combinations of operations might be less efficient than the original einops

## Future Improvements

While the current implementation meets all requirements, potential improvements could include:

Support for other tensor libraries (PyTorch, TensorFlow)
Implementation of the reduce and repeat operations
Even further performance optimizations for specific patterns
JIT compilation for performance-critical paths

The implementation is well-documented with comments and type hints to make it maintainable and extensible for future enhancements.RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.Claude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
